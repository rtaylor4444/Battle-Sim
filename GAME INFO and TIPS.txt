This game follows a combat triangle so generally:
Attack beats Defense (Can negate armor and out damage defense)
Defense beats Speed (deal rebound damage and easily tanks hits)
Speed beats Attack (Can easily evade and strike back)

There is a hidden armor stat in this game which is determined by base defense
This is what allows skills to do 0 damage after the atk/def ratio.
Blocking gives extra armor and certain skills can negate that effect:
*Power Lunge (techincally no but usually has enough power to deal damage)
*Piercing Blow
*Fierce Assault

Speed allows you to evade more hits
When you graze that means you're only dealing a percent of your original damage.
Strike Window determines whether you graze your opponent or not
of course if you outpace your opponent your moves will always land
*Ex: If you have 50 speed an opponent needs 25 speed to graze you; 24 misses
     (Although armor will negate out that small amount of damage)
*Better Ex: If you have 50 speed an opponent needs around 37-40 speed to deal OK damage
These skills make it harder for your opponent to hit you:
*Hasty Tackle (Increases speed not strike window but still makes it harder to hit)
*Quick Fient
*Swift Retaliate
*Rapid Blitz

There are what I like to call traps in this game which activate
when your opponent lauches an attack.
The two types of traps are reactive and preemptive traps:
*Reactive Traps give the greatest defense but require the user to tank
 the hit to deal rebound damage.
*Preemptive Traps allow the user to attempt to strike before their opponent; 
also doubles as a way to 'trade' damage

All traps deal damage based on the defense stat:
It is possible to use defense as a weapon in this game!
*Counter Parry (Reactive)
*Swift Retaliate (Reactive *must dodge hit instead of block)
*Preemptive Press (Preemptive)
*Keen Intercept (Preemptive)
*Strong Garrison (Reactive)

There are also two kinds of buffs in this game temporary buffs and stage modifiers.
*Temporary Buffs are given to you depending what skill you use for that turn
 (You can see these in skill description window)
*Stage Modifiers are applied when using these skills during your turn
 *Immense Strength
 *Nimble Movement
 *Acute Awareness
 *Weaken Muscles (assuming skill works successfully)
 *Impede Movement (assuming skill works successfully)
 *Break Fortitude (assuming skill works successfully)
*Stage Modifier formula (you can only +1 or -1 as of v1.1):
 -4  -3  -2  -1   0    +1   +2   +3   +4
 50% 57% 66% 80% 100% 125% 150% 175% 200%

Typically buffs/debuffs should be used to supplement your chosen skills
since dealing with temporary buffs are more important.
